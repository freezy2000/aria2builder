aria2 - all in one command line download tool

Many of as are using wget as a quick command line download tool to fetch data from the web using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. 
We usually pick download mirror closest to our location in hope for better download speed, start wget and hoping for 
the best. Aria2 download tool offers an alternative solution to wget with increased potential for greater download 
speed by downloading from more than one source in the single session.

Along the usual protocols supported by wget aria2 also offers download resume and additional download options using 
torrents, magnet URIs and metalinks. This article explores some aria2 download techniques which potentially could 
ease wget's work load.

Aria2 installation
First if you have not done so yet install aria2 package from your systemâ€™s repository such us:

Centos:
# yum install aria2
Ubuntu:
# apt-get install aria2
You can also install aria2 from a source code downloaded from aria2 home page.

Aria2 basic download
Same as it is with wget aria2 also offers one argument command line download. Lets try download such us:
$ aria2c ftp://local1/linux-distro.iso

Download from more sources
To speed up your download you can supply aria2 with more than one source of the same file:
$ aria2c ftp://local1/linux-distro.iso http://local2/linux-distro.iso

Torrent download
Downloading data using torrents is simple as downloading data via http or ftp. If you alredy have a torrent file which 
you want to use to fetch your data, simply suppy it to aria2 as a command line argument:
$ aria2c linux-dist.torrent
$ aria2c http://local/linux-dist.torrent
$ aria2c --follow-torrent=mem http://local/linux-dist.torrent

Download using metalink
Metalink is a file which contains all possible sources for data to be downloaded. Which means that instead supplying 
aria2 with a multiple sources we need to supply just a single metalink URL or metalink file. For example, you can 
download Ubuntu TLS Linux ISO using metalink:
aria2c http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.metalink

Download via torrent magnet
As you may have already guessed the syntax to download via torrent magnets is the same as it was in previous examples. 
All what needs to be done is to supply aria2 with a magnet link:
aria2c magnet:?xt=urn:btih:1e99d95f1764644a86a8e99bfd80c ...
